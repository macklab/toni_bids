# toni_bids
Tutorial dataset for using BIDS, mriqc, and fmriprep. Based on talk during ToNI Users meeting June 1, 2018.

Note, the neuroimaging data files are not included here. You can download the dicoms for 2 participants (each ~1GB): 
1. [sub-101.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vi7kj42j321htjm/sub-101.tar.gz?dl=0)
2. [sub-102.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7oi33ar3lfabduy/sub-102.tar.gz?dl=0)

Untar and place each participants' dicom directory in the toni_bids/sourcedata directory, then run the commands found in toni_bids/code/preprocessing.sh.
